# Document Management System

Simulation for a program design request for a dentist business
who would like to automate their document management.

## Requirements

*   Reports:    A body of text detailing some consultation of operation on a patient.
*   Letters:    A text document that gets sent to an address.
*   Images: The dental practice often records x-rays of photos of teeth and gums.
*   Documents:  Need to record path to file that is being managed and reference the correct patient.
### Feature Requests:
*   Searching the documents.
*   Query whether the attributes of different type documents contain certain pieces of information.
*   Design for implementation of more document file types in the future.

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
