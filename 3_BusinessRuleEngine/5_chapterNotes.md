# Chapter 5 Notes:

### Test-Driven-Development:
Using "TDD" is beneficial for a few reasons; it can help us focus on / refine requirements,
assures organized code, and improves meeting requirements for development requests.

``` 
__The TDD Cycle:
1.  Write a test that fails.
2.  Run tests.
3.  Refactor.
4.  Run tests.
5.  Add tets.
```
This process forces us to constantly refactor our code otherwise it will end up unmaintainable.
